1. For cancer diseases, usually what are the general treatments to cover when answering treatment question? \n
2. For cancer diseases, don't consider context that is not primary tumor/cancer related, unless the question specifically mention it is secondary tumor/cancer related.\n

# Evaluation
CORRECTNESS_PROMPT = """You are an impartial judge. Evaluate Student Answer against Ground Truth for conceptual similarity and correctness. 
You may also be given additional information that was used by the model to generate the output.

Your task is to determine a numerical score called correctness based on the Student Answer and Ground Truth.
A definition of correctness and a grading rubric are provided below.
You must use the grading rubric to determine your score.

Metric definition:
Correctness assesses the degree to which a provided Student Answer aligns with factual accuracy, completeness, logical 
consistency, and precise terminology of the Ground Truth. It evaluates the intrinsic validity of the Student Answer , independent of any 
external context. A higher score indicates a higher adherence to factual accuracy, completeness, logical consistency, 
and precise terminology of the Ground Truth.

Grading rubric:
Correctness: Below are the details for different scores: 
 - 1: Major factual errors, highly incomplete, illogical, and uses incorrect terminology.
 - 2: Significant factual errors, incomplete, noticeable logical flaws, and frequent terminology errors.
 - 3: Minor factual errors, somewhat incomplete, minor logical inconsistencies, and occasional terminology errors.
 - 4: Few to no factual errors, mostly complete, strong logical consistency, and accurate terminology.
 - 5: Accurate, complete, logically consistent, and uses precise terminology.
 
 Reminder:
  - Carefully read the Student Answer and Ground Truth
  - Check for factual accuracy and completeness of Student Answer compared to the Ground Truth
  - Focus on correctness of information rather than style or verbosity
  - The goal is to evaluate factual correctness and completeness of the Student Answer.
  - Please provide your answer score only with the numerical number between 1 and 5. No score: or other text is allowed.

FAITHFULNESS_PROMPT = """You are an impartial judge. Evaluate output against context for faithfulness. 
You may also be given additional information that was used by the model to generate the Output.

Your task is to determine a numerical score called faithfulness based on the output and context.
A definition of faithfulness and a grading rubric are provided below.
You must use the grading rubric to determine your score.

Metric definition:
Faithfulness is only evaluated with the provided output and context. Faithfulness assesses how much of the 
provided output is factually consistent with the provided context. A higher score indicates that a higher proportion of 
claims present in the output can be derived from the provided context. Faithfulness does not consider how much extra 
information from the context is not present in the output.

Grading rubric:
Faithfulness: Below are the details for different scores:
- Score 1: None of the claims in the output can be inferred from the provided context.
- Score 2: Some of the claims in the output can be inferred from the provided context, but the majority of the output is missing from, inconsistent with, or contradictory to the provided context.
- Score 3: Half or more of the claims in the output can be inferred from the provided context.
- Score 4: Most of the claims in the output can be inferred from the provided context, with very little information that is not directly supported by the provided context.
- Score 5: All of the claims in the output are directly supported by the provided context, demonstrating high faithfulness to the provided context.

Reminder:
- Carefully read the output and context
- Focus on the information instead of the writing style or verbosity.
