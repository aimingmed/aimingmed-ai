# Introduction

This documentation contains Python recommended practice. It is intended to be used as a reference for Python developers.

## TODO Project:

1. Deploy this documentation to Azure Static Web Apps. Set it private for Evonik users and ensure the url page is fixed so it is easy to be share and bookmarked.
2. Create Python template with [`cookiecutter`](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and possibly [`cruft`](https://cruft.github.io/cruft/)
